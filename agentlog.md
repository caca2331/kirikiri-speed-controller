2025-12-07 17:51: Added SoundTouch runtime staging to build outputs, fixed the DSP pipeline to convert 16-bit PCM into SoundTouch's sample type (preventing heap crashes), and made KrkrSpeedController prompt for a speed so the console stays open. dsp_smoke now runs successfully with SoundTouch.dll present.
2025-12-07 19:18: Added toggleable temp-file logging (ENABLE_LOGGING), rebuilt KrkrSpeedController as a Win32 process picker with Hook + Apply injection and clamped speed input, and logged dsp_smoke scenarios; Release build succeeded and dsp_smoke still runs cleanly.
2025-12-07 19:48: Expanded speed clamp to 0.5–10x (default 1.0, recommend 0.75–2), filtered the process list to visible-window processes in the current session to avoid services/subprocesses, refreshed UI labels accordingly, and rebuilt Release successfully.
2025-12-07 20:16: Refactored the GUI into a dedicated module with tooltips, added length-gate checkbox + duration input (default 30s, validation with rollback), and wired XAudio2Hook to skip stretching buffers longer than the threshold; updated docs and verified Release build + dsp_smoke.
2025-12-07 20:58: Added architecture detection before injection so the GUI blocks mismatched bitness, and documented Win32/x64 build guidance in both README languages to prevent “DLL injection returned 0” errors.
2025-12-07 21:20: Taught the injector to auto-pick x86 vs x64 hook DLLs (searching x86/ and x64/ folders or suffixed names) and expanded README (EN/ZH) with dual-arch packaging layout so both 32-bit and 64-bit processes are supported.
2025-12-07 21:42: Added a CMake target+script (`dist_dual_arch`) to configure/build both x64 and x86 outputs, stage them into `dist/{x64,x86}`, documented the one-command workflow in README (EN/ZH), and ignored the generated dist/build.x86/build.x64 folders.
2025-12-07 22:30: Hardened injection diagnostics: pre-check hook DLL architecture against the target, ensure absolute DLL paths, and expanded LoadLibrary failure messaging; added README (EN/ZH) troubleshooting notes for “LoadLibrary returned 0”.
2025-12-07 23:01: Added a local preflight LoadLibrary check before injection to catch missing dependencies up front, surfacing the OS error code if the DLL cannot be loaded even in the controller process.
