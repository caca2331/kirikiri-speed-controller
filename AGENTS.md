## MOST IMPORTANT
- (sandbox_mode = "workspace-write") NEVER change/remove/add files outside the workspace.
- (approval_policy = "never") Don't ask for approval for making changes within the workspace, you have the approval. 
- (features.web_search_request = true) You are granted permission of network access for searching solutions and documentations. 
- (sandbox_workspace_write.network_access = false) Don't Download anything or install any packages from the Internet. If essential, ask for permissions.

## General rules
- (first time only) Read AGENTS.md (this file), guide.md, README.md;
AGENTS.md defines the overall agent behavior.
guide.md has the goal of the project.
README.md is purposed for instructing the users.
runtime-notes.md records key observations/ideas that are not explained elsewhere regarding to the project/tasks that you discovered. Append note on it when you think necessary. You don't need to read it though unless asked.
draft.md is for my own purpose. ignore it.
- If task is ambiguous, ask for clarifications if necessary before executing tasks.
- After finish a task, update Readme if necessary. 
- Log essential information, and use them for debugging.
- Notify me in your next response when you did a context window length compress.
- Unless you have to, prevent small and frequent patches, to reduce the amount of work of mine testing.
- Make source files concise and organized. Try keep each file below 1000 lines, or by best below 500 lines.
- Put instructions in this file in high priority. Keep them in your context window.

## Rules for this project
- (First time only) Make sure you read all files in src and cmake folder.
- For this project, log files should be located in ./dist/x86/ or ./dist/x64
- It could be hard for you to fully detect the result. The interaction would be: I give you instructions -> you think deeply, check for information (look at log, code, online resources/documentations, etc.), then ask for clarification if any -> I answer -> You start coding, make the executable and stage if there's code change, finally tell me what you did (not detail, but the key summary) and instruct me how to test. (during which, follow AGENTS.md) -> I run test, generate log file, give you instructions.
